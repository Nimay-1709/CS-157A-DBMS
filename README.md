# CS-157A-DBMS

Project 1:
Download SQLITE source code and modify the sqlInt.h and Insert.c files to solve following problems:
Problem Statement:Problem 1:First take a look at the following SQLITE3 shell-SQL commands and responses:sqlite> create table cs157a(sjsu_id int, name varchar(5));sqlite> insert into cs157a values(1050,'Mary');sqlite> insert into cs157a values(1001,'Alice');sqlite> insert into cs157a values(1200,'Trudy');sqlite> insert into cs157a values(1001,'John');sqlite> insert into cs157a values(2050,'Judy', 'A+');Error: table cs157ahas 2columns but 3 values were suppliedWe created a new table (cs157a) with 2columns, then we tried to insert a new tuple into this table but only 3 values were specified instead of 2values. This led to the error “Error: table cs157ahas 2columns but3 values were supplied”. It will be helpful, ifthis error message can provide more information e.g. schema of the table.So, in this project you have to make the change to SQLite source code so that the response to such user error looks like:sqlite> insert into cs157a values(2050,'Judy','A+');Metadata help: cs157a{sjsu_id,name}Error: table cs157a has 2 columns but 3 values were suppliedProblem 2:ORDER BY sorts the output rows in ascendingorder (by default). In this project, you have to change the default behavior to descendingorder.
Example:sqlite> select * from cs157a order by sjsu_id;sjsu_id     name      --------------------1200        Trudy     1050        Mary      1001        Alice     1001        JohnTake a look at the output table, all rows are in descending order of sjsu_id column values but SQL query did not specify order by sjsu_id desc.C language skills:1.Printf2.STRUCT 3.Array4.Pointers5.define6.for loop to traverse array of STRUCTExample:sqlite> select * from cs157a order by sjsu_id;sjsu_id     name      --------------------1200        Trudy     1050        Mary      1001        Alice     1001        JohnTake a look at the output table, all rows are in descending order of sjsu_id column values but SQL query did not specify order by sjsu_id desc.
